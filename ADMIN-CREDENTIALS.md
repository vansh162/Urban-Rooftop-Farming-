# Leafinity – Admin login

Use these credentials to sign in as **admin** (after running the server seed script).

| Field     | Value                 |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Email**    | `admin@leafinity.com` |
| **Password** | `admin123`            |

- Login URL: `/login` (e.g. `http://localhost:5173/login`).
- After login, admins are redirected to `/admin`.

**Note:** The admin user is created when you run `npm run seed` (or `run-seed.bat`) in the `server` folder. If you haven’t run the seed yet, create the admin first by running the seed script.
